How to use
==========

Just load up `build/Immutable.js`. It works with AMD, CommonJS / Node.js, and browser globals.

You can find documentation in the `doc` folder.

Run the benchmarks with `node build/Benchmark.js`. This will take a long time (several minutes, possibly hours). You can find old benchmarks in the `benchmarks` folder.

Run tests by using `node build/Test.js`.
