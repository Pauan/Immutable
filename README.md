How to use
==========

Just load up `build/Immutable.js`. It works with AMD, CommonJS / Node.js, and browser globals.

You can find documentation in the `doc` folder.

You can find benchmarks in the `benchmarks` folder.


For developers
==============

You'll probably need to use `npm install` to get the required dependencies. Every time you make a change to the `src` directory, you have to run `npm install` to rebuild.

Run the benchmarks with `node build/Benchmark.js`. This will take a long time (several minutes, possibly hours).

Run the tests by using `node build/Test.js`.
