/**
   @function toArray
   @param {::Iterable} [x]
   @return {Array}
   @summary Converts an [::Iterable] to a JavaScript Array
   @desc
     If `x` is already a JavaScript Array, it is returned as-is.

     If `x` is an [::Iterable], it is converted into a JavaScript Array
     and returned.

     This is useful because most iteration functions do not return
     arrays, they return Iterables.
