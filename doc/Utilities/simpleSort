/**
   @function simpleSort
   @param {Any} [x] Value to be sorted
   @param {Any} [y] Value to be sorted
   @return {Integer} Whether `x` is lower than, equal to, or greater than `y`
   @summary Returns whether `x` is lower than, equal to, or greater than `y`
   @desc
     This function can be used with [::SortedDict] and [::SortedSet].

     * If `x` is lower than `y`, it returns `-1`
     * If `x` is equal to `y`, it returns `0`
     * If `x` is greater than `y`, it returns `1`

     This function only works on simple types (numbers, strings, and booleans).

     In addition, it requires all the values to be the same type.
     Mixing two or more types together will not work correctly.

     e.g. You shouldn't use this function if you want to use both
     numbers and strings as keys in the same Dict/Set.

     If you want a sort function that works on anything, use [::defaultSort].
