/**
   @function equal
   @param {Any} [x]
   @param {Any} [y]
   @return {Boolean} `true` if `x` and `y` are equal
   @summary Returns whether `x` and `y` are equal
   @desc
     Simple things like numbers and strings are
     treated as equal if they have the same value:

         equal(1, 1); // true
         equal("foo", "foo"); // true

     This takes `O(1)` time.

     ----

     Mutable objects are treated as equal if they
     are exactly the same object:

         var obj = {};

         equal(obj, obj); // true

     This takes `O(1)` time.

     ----

     [::Dict] are treated as equal if they have
     the same keys/values:

         equal(Dict({ foo: 1 }),
               Dict({ foo: 1 })); // true

     This takes `O(n)` time, except the results
     are cached so that afterwards it takes `O(1)`
     time.

     ----

     [::Set] are treated as equal if they have
     the same values:

         equal(Set([1]),
               Set([1])); // true

     This takes `O(n)` time, except the results
     are cached so that afterwards it takes `O(1)`
     time.

     ----

     [::List] are treated as equal if they have
     the same values in the same order:

         equal(List([1]),
               List([1])); // true

     This takes `O(n)` time, except the results
     are cached so that afterwards it takes `O(1)`
     time.

     ----

     [::Queue] are treated as equal if they have
     the same values in the same order:

         equal(Queue([1]),
               Queue([1])); // true

     This takes `O(n)` time, except the results
     are cached so that afterwards it takes `O(1)`
     time.

     ----

     [::Stack] are treated as equal if they have
     the same values in the same order:

         equal(Stack([1]),
               Stack([1])); // true

     This takes `O(n)` time, except the results
     are cached so that afterwards it takes `O(1)`
     time.

     ----

     [::SortedDict] and [::SortedSet] are the
     same as [::Dict] and [::Set] except that
     the sort order must also be the same.
