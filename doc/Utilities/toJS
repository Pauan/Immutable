/**
   @function toJS
   @param {Any} [x]
   @return {Any}
   @summary Converts a [::Dict], [::Set], [::List],
            [::Queue], [::Stack], or [::Record] to its
            JavaScript equivalent
   @desc
     Most things are returned as-is, except:

     * [::Dict] are converted to a JavaScript object. The keys must be strings or [::Tag].
     * [::Set] are converted to a JavaScript array.
     * [::List] are converted to a JavaScript array.
     * [::Queue] are converted to a JavaScript array.
     * [::Stack] are converted to a JavaScript array.
     * [::Record] are converted to a JavaScript object.

     This conversion takes `O(n)` time.

     This is useful if you like using [::Dict], [::Set],
     [::List], [::Queue], [::Stack], or [::Record] but you want
     to use a library that requires ordinary JavaScript
     objects/arrays.

     If you want to losslessly store an immutable object on
     disk, or send it over the network, you can use [::toJSON]
     and [::fromJSON] instead.
