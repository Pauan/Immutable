/**
   @function fromJS
   @param {Any} [x]
   @return {Any}
   @summary Converts a JavaScript object into its Immutable equivalent
   @desc
     This function has the following behavior:

     * JavaScript object literals are deeply converted
       into a [::Dict], with [::fromJS] called on all
       the keys/values.

       This conversion takes `O(n)` time.

     * JavaScript arrays are deeply converted into a
       [::List], with [::fromJS] called on all the
       values.

       This conversion takes `O(n)` time.

     * Everything else is returned as-is.

     ----

     This is useful if you like using [::Dict] or [::List],
     but you want to use a library that gives you ordinary
     JavaScript objects/arrays.

     If you want to losslessly store an immutable object on
     disk, or send it over the network, you can use [::toJSON]
     and [::fromJSON] instead.
