/**
   @function fromJS
   @param {Any} [x]
   @return {Any}
   @summary Converts a JavaScript object into its Immutable equivalent
   @desc
     Most things are returned as-is, except:

     * JavaScript object literals are converted into a [::Dict].
     * JavaScript arrays are converted into a [::List].

     This conversion takes `O(n)` time.

     This is useful if you like using [::Dict] or [::List],
     but you want to use a library that gives you ordinary
     JavaScript objects/arrays.

     If you want to losslessly store an Immutable object on
     disk, or send it over the network, you can use [::toJSON]
     and [::fromJSON] instead.
