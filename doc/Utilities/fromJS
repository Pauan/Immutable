/**
   @function fromJS
   @param {Any} [x]
   @return {Any}
   @summary Converts a JavaScript object into its Immutable equivalent
   @desc
     Most things are returned as-is, except:

     * JavaScript object literals are converted into a [::Dict].
     * JavaScript arrays are converted into a [::List].

     This conversion takes `O(n)` time.

     This is useful if you like using [::Dict], [::Set],
     [::List], [::Queue], or [::Stack] but you want to use a
     library that gives you ordinary JavaScript objects/arrays.
