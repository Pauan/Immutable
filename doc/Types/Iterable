/**
   @class Iterable
   @summary Anything that can be iterated
   @desc
     If something is [::Iterable], it can be used by the iteration functions
     like [::each], [::map], [::zip], etc.

     All [::Iterable] things can be converted into an [::Iterator]
     using [::toIterator].

     ----

     These things are Iterable:

     * JavaScript Array

     * JavaScript String

     * ECMAScript 6 Iterable

     * The return value of the [::Iterable] function.

     * [::Dict], [::List], [::Queue], [::Record], [::Set], [::Stack], and [::Tuple]

   @function Iterable
   @param {Function} [fn]
   @desc
     This function will call `fn` with no arguments.
     `fn` is supposed to return an [::Iterator].

     It will then wrap the iterator so that it is recognized
     as an [::Iterable].

     This is useful to create your own iteration functions.

     See also [::toIterator].
